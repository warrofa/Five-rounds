# Five-rounds
Character oriented ciphers are encryption algorithms that manipulate text to produce a ciphered text. 
In this report we, group three, undertake the task of creating an asymmetric cryptographic solution that 
preserves integrity and confidentiality of a message by referencing algorithms that changed the cryptographic 
world such DES and RSA and using skills and knowledge we gained during information security course.
